        "text": "Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact with and operate within the physical world, as opposed to purely software-based AI that exists only in digital environments. Physical AI systems are embodied in physical forms such as robots, humanoids, and other mechanical agents that can perceive, reason, and act upon real-world environments. These systems integrate traditional AI capabilities like perception, learning, and decision-making with physical actuators and sensors that allow them to manipulate objects, navigate spaces, and interact with physical materials.",

        "text": "Physical AI differs fundamentally from conventional software AI by requiring real-time interaction with physical laws, materials, and environments. While traditional AI processes data and generates responses in virtual spaces, Physical AI must account for gravity, friction, material properties, and dynamic physical interactions. This creates unique challenges in control theory, sensor fusion, and real-time decision making. Physical AI systems must handle uncertainty in both perception and action, as sensor data can be noisy and physical actions may have unpredictable outcomes due to environmental factors.",

    {
        "text": "Examples of Physical AI include humanoid robots, industrial automation systems, autonomous vehicles, and embodied agents that perform tasks in unstructured environments. These systems represent the convergence of artificial intelligence, robotics, and mechanical engineering, creating intelligent agents that can perform complex physical tasks while adapting to changing conditions. Physical AI is essential for applications where digital intelligence must manifest in physical form, such as assistive robotics, manufacturing, exploration, and human-robot interaction scenarios.",
